We are in the early stages of setting up a Southern California PowerShell user group. This site will serve as an information source on the activities of the group.

At the moment, we are working with schedules to set a date and venue for an introductory meeting. We have not officially announced anything at this point, so please be patient. I am also taking this time to get the site up and working before we are expecting any visitors.

Thank you for your patience.
