The SoCal PowerShell user group is looking for presenters for our upcoming meetings. We would love it if you could join us in person, but we are also accepting remote presenters. This is a very welcoming group and open to all topics related to PowerShell.

Our group meets on the first Tuesday of the month at 6:30 PM Pacific time with the presentations starting closer to 6:45.

Please take a quick peek at our [schedule](/schedule) and let us know if you could cover one of our open sessions.

Thank you,

Kevin Marquette
