Thank you everyone that made it out tonight. I also want to thank David Christian for presenting tonight. I have already been working with Plaster and I still picked up a few things.

The materials for tonight's [presentation is available on GitHub](https://github.com/dchristian3188/DemoWorkingWithPlaster). The video from tonights meeting is up on YouTube: [Working with Plaster - SoCalPosh September 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhZaEbk5nfs). For some additional examples, David has some personal plaster templates [posted here](https://github.com/dchristian3188/PlasterTemplates) and I have a few [templates posted here](https://github.com/KevinMarquette/PlasterTemplates).

If you have any feedback (good or bad) on tonight's presentation, I am sure that David would love to have it. If you have any questions about the group or would like to provide feedback about the group or meeting in general, please reach out to David or myself.

I will be presenting next month on PSGraph. [Please RSVP](https://www.meetup.com/preview/SoCal-PowerShell-user-group/events/241536557) and I look forward to seeing you all again next month.
