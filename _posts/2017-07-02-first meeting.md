Our introductory meeting will be Tuesday August 1st in the Irvine/Lake Forest CA area. I am still waiting on confirmation from our venue before I announce it.

Kevin Marquette will be our speaker with a presentation on hashtables. "Everything you ever wanted to know about hashtables". It should offer something for everyone.
